### Administration module reference project
This project is a reference for technologies, architecture and best practices used by me. Because of this, currently there is a lot of infrastructure code here, but with not many real features implemented.

##### Technologies used

* **Core**: Entity Framework 6.0, Fluent Validation  
* **Web**: ASP.NET Web API 2.0, Castle Windsor, AutoMapper, 
* **Client**: AngularJS 1.2, Bootstrap 3.0, Angular-Bootstrap 1.2
* **Tests**: xUnit 2.0, NSubstitute, Fluent Assertions, Selenium

##### This is how main view currently looks like
